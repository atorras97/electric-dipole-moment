# Electric dipole moment of a flux qubit

The notebook presents a simple implementation using scqubits v3.2.0 to calculate the electric dipole moment of a 3JJ flux qubit. 

The mathematical derivation of $d_{01}$ can be found in the PhD thesis: *Superinductive Ultrastrong Couplings in Superconducting quantum Circuits*, Alba Torras-Coloma, 2025.
